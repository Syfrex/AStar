The Youtube videdo I watched for this project is called "Unity - A Star Pathinding Tutorial": https://youtu.be/AKKpPmxx07w
Its made by a guy called "danielmccluskey" on Github and a link to the code from the video can be found here: https://github.com/danielmccluskey/A-Star-Pathfinding-Tutorial

I tried my best not to copy to much from him but there was a calculation with the "Manhattan Distance" that required do
make logic simular to his. I have added my own logic untop of his and removed/optimized a lot. The gizmos is however copied and pasted
to show how the A Star works. 

Also: I've learned much about A Star at: https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html 
and strongly recommend you to show this to future students that are interested. Its an interactable website
that talks about the various types of A Star.
